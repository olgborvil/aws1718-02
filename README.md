* [Heroku App](https://aws1718-02.herokuapp.com/)
* [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xo8pYsMbjnRDM3UBgZUkJKbEzddfJm4pgwJ_fQ7_D8U/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Postman tests](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3947164/aws-1718-02/RVtvqYmp)

When using the app or running custom Postman tests, bear in mind that you will need to attach the right apikey, which, by now, is '**asdf1234**'
